# Description
This repo contains notes detailing my learnings related to the Firecracker microVM project.

I am primarily using this as a learning aid and "second brain" -- good note taking requires me to process the ideas I encounter more effectively, and the result lives on for posterity (and my forgetful future self) to reference later.

# Structure
Currently, I don't have _super_ specific ideas about the structure of the notes contained in this repository. The plan is to just make a Markdown file named by the current week that details what I've learned that week. I'll probably add headings to delineate different topics, but that's about it. Of course, this may change as I add more.
